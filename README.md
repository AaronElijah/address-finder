# Getting Started with Octopus Wealth Address Finder

Here is my demo of the mock up address finger for Octopus Wealth's technical interview. The aim is to type in the duration you stay at an address, search for an address using an
external API endpoint, choose the address and then edit/save/delete that address. When designing this mock-up, I thought about how best to showcase skills in React. This includes using the Context API/reducer pattern for application state management, splitting components into purely UI views or stateful functional components and integration testing with react-testing-library.

To view, please visit https://aaronelijah.github.io/address-finder/ or run locally by cloning the repo and running `npm run install && npm run start` from root directory.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm deploy`

Builds the app for production and deploys to github pages.

### `npm format`

Use Prettier to format TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS modules.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
